name is 'Diary'

user setup online account using facebook or google

Logistics
Add 'prettier'
    setup prettier to user 4-spaced indents and apply changes auto. on save
    https://github.com/prettier/prettier

Use Eslint (or is prettier enough?)

Use config and env (for debug and deploy mode)
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv

Use advance CSS (variables, SCSS, Less)

    SCSS needs a ruby based compiler/pre-processor called 'compass'
    LESS uses a webstorm plugin (yarn global add less)
    VERDICT: LESS is easier to setup in webstorm than SCSS
